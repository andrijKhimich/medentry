                <p>The UCAT testing period is a big month for many students across Australasia and even other countries
                  around the world.
                  For information on what is a 'good' UCAT score, check out our dedicated blog. It can feel really
                  disappointing if, like
                  me, you logged in to see your UCAT score report and were met with a non-competitive score. I
                  understand that it can feel
                  like the world is ending, and all hopes have been flushed down the toilet, but I am here to tell you
                  otherwise!
                </p>
                <h5 class="title-5">My Story</h5>
                <p>When I was in year 12, I made my first attempt of getting into medicine and received a score in the
                  88th percentile. At
                  first, I felt like I still had a fighting chance at Medicine, but unfortunately, I just missed out!
                  Naturally, I bawled
                  my eyes out and was left mentally vacant for the following couple of days. But, 2 years later, I can
                  confidently say
                  that receiving that score was one of the best things that ever happened to me.</p>
                <p>There are some students who take two gap years! A student scored 70th percentile in the first
                  attempt; 87th in the first
                  gap year and 98th in the second gap year. She ended up with 6 interviews and four medical school
                  offers! I took a second
                  attempt at medical entry after my disappointing result back in Year 12, and received a total UCAT
                  score of 3040 (about
                  97th percentile). I believe this shows that you can also surpass this same obstacle, that I have
                  overcome, by working
                  hard and persevering through your failures!</p>

                <h5 class="title-5">Other Pathways Into Medicine</h5>
                <p>Getting into medicine straight from high school is not the ONLY way to get in. The beauty of medicine
                  is that there are
                  many pathways that you can go down to follow your dreams. If you don’t get a competitive UCAT score,
                  there are four main
                  pathways for entry into medicine: School Leaver Entry, Guaranteed Entry, Non-Standard Entry and
                  Graduate Entry.</p>
                <h6 class="title-6">School Leaver Entry</h6>
                <p>If your UCAT score was not competitive enough, the only public university that does not consider UCAT
                  for direct entry
                  is James Cook University (JCU). However, JCU has a particular focus on rural-based medicine, and if
                  you lack experience
                  in these areas, it might be a little more difficult to get in. The private Bond University also does
                  not require UCAT.</p>
                <p>If your ATAR is high, it’s worth it to take a gap year and attempt the UCAT next year. This way
                  you’re still considered
                  a ‘school leaver’ and will still be eligible for entry into all universities offering undergraduate
                  medicine. This is
                  what I did, and I found that all the volunteering/paid work I did during my gap year, along with the
                  overall life
                  lessons I learnt in that year helped me develop my interpersonal skills (useful for interviews), and
                  made me even more
                  determined to get into Medicine!</p>
                <h6 class="title-6">Guaranteed/Provisional Entry</h6>
                <p>If your ATAR is extremely competitive, you can apply for provisional entry into medicine at
                  universities such as the
                  University of Sydney, Griffith University and the University of Melbourne. These three provisional
                  entry courses do not
                  require UCAT, while some other provisional entry courses such as UWA, Flinders and the University of
                  Queensland do
                  require a good UCAT score.</p>
                <p>This pathway requires you to complete a prerequisite undergraduate degree first before commencing
                  Medicine. Note that
                  you do not need to sit the GAMSAT if you follow this route. This route has some disadvantages,
                  including that it is
                  longer, and there is a risk you may lose your place in medicine if you do not perform well in your
                  first degree.</p>
                <h6 class="title-6">Non-Standard Entry</h6>
                <p>If you have/want to commence an undergraduate degree, some universities will allow you to transfer
                  into Medicine during
                  your degree if you choose to do so. This process requires you to sit UCAT again. Admission
                  requirements vary across
                  universities for Non-Standard Entry. Note that some universities such as Adelaide will not accept
                  students who have
                  commenced the degree at a university other than their own. Furthermore, for the universities that do
                  accept non-school
                  leavers, there are less available spaces. This is why taking a gap year can be advantageous to
                  students with competitive
                  ATARs.</p>
                <h6 class="title-6">Graduate Entry</h6>
                <p>The Graduate Entry pathway requires you to first complete an undergraduate degree before applying for
                  postgraduate
                  Medicine. This pathway is different from ‘Provisional Entry’ in that to be eligible, you must sit an
                  entrance test in
                  combination with completing your degree. While most universities require you to sit GAMSAT, some
                  universities (such as
                  WSU, Newcastle, Auckland and Otago) require that you sit UCAT instead.</p>
                <p>Note that some universities such as Monash Graduate Entry do not require GAMSAT if students do well
                  in their degree
                  program (universities have started to offer this to entice students into their university programs).
                </p>
                <p>If applying for Graduate Entry medicine, it is advised that you undertake both the UCAT, as well as
                  the GAMSAT, to
                  increase your chances of being offered a place. Further, UCAT is a shorter exam (2 hours as opposed to
                  a 4.45 hour
                  exam), and generally considered to be easier to prepare for. Not to mention that the cost of GAMSAT
                  preparation courses
                  can run into thousands of dollars!</p>
                <p>At most universities, the undergraduate degree you choose to study when applying for Graduate entry
                  medicine can cover
                  any area of study and does not have to be science/health related. In fact, it is advised that you do
                  not undertake
                  degrees such as ‘advanced science’ and ‘biomedical science’. This is because although universities
                  advertise these
                  courses as ‘pathways to medicine’, if you do not get into Medicine, there are limited career options
                  available with
                  these courses. Furthermore, since you can apply to most medical courses after completing ANY area of
                  study, completing a
                  non-health related degree will leave room for other career options if you start to feel unsure about
                  Medicine or are
                  unable to get into medicine.</p>
                <h5 class="title-5">A Final Word</h5>
                <p>There are advantages and disadvantages to each pathway into Medicine. At the end of the day, if your
                  UCAT doesn’t get
                  you an interview offer, remember that there are so many opportunities left to follow your dreams. All
                  you have to do is
                  work hard and smart. Note that the most common pathways into medicine (school leaver entry with a gap
                  year and non
                  standard entry) require you to sit UCAT. Therefore, you should consider commencing quality UCAT
                  preparation. Preparing
                  for UCAT over a period of time is the best way to succeed. For more information, check out our blog on
                  distributed
                  practice.</p>

                  failure.</p>
