                <h3 class="title-3">What is<span> UCAT</span></h3>
                <p>UCAT stands for University Clinical Aptitude Test. UCAT is one of three main criteria used by most
                  universities in
                  Australia and New Zealand to select students into high demand health related careers such as
                  medicine
                  and dentistry (the
                  other two criteria being performance in final high school exams and interviews).</p>
                <p>The UCAT is a two hour, computer-based test which assesses a range of mental abilities identified
                  by
                  universities as
                  important to practicing in the fields of medicine and dentistry. It consists of five separately
                  timed
                  subtests which
                  each contain a number of questions in a multiple-choice format.</p>

                <h3 class="title-3">Why<span> UCAT</span></h3>
                <p>Because the demand for medicine, dentistry and some other health science courses is so significant,
                  the year 12 score
                  required to get into such courses became extremely high. Universities therefore needed another
                  method
                  for selecting
                  students into medicine.
                </p>
                <p>UCAT was developed with the goal to assess qualities considered desirable in the health
                  professions,
                  including problem
                  solving, empathy and abstract reasoning skills. Many universities also use an interview to select
                  students into medicine
                  and dentistry.</p>
                <p>Whether or not you agree that UCAT effectively assesses qualities required to be a successful
                  medical
                  student and
                  doctor, the reality is that you must sit UCAT to gain entry into many health science courses.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, the Consortium of Australian School Leaver Entry Universities decided that UCAT was a
                  more suitable test for
                  assessing candidates for entry into medical and dental courses. UCAT was introduced from 24
                  September
                  2018 and the first
                  sitting of UCAT was during July 2019.</p>

                <p>UCAT is a very difficult test! The questions are completely different to those you will have
                  encountered at school or

                  1. Understand the <span>importance of UCAT</span>
                </h4>
                <p>UCAT is often as important, and in some cases is more important, than your year 12 score in
                  determining whether or not
                  you will get into medicine. Even if you achieve a perfect ATAR of 99.95, this does not guarantee you a
                  place in medicine
                  at all universities. Some universities do not even consider your year final 12 score in deciding
                  whether or not you will
                  be offered an interview for medicine – they only consider UCAT initially.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, most students do not recognise the importance of UCAT and some do not even prepare,
                  and therefore miss
                  out on getting into their dream course.</p>
                <p>MedEntry recommends treating UCAT as another subject and allocating your time accordingly – if you
                  are in year 12 you
                  should spend about 10% of your study time on UCAT, and consider increasing this as the UCAT draws
                  closer.</p>

                <h4 class="title-4">2. Familiarise yourself with <span>UCAT-style questions</span></h4>
                <p>The first step in studying for UCAT is to understand the types of questions that you will face. UCAT
                  is not a test of knowledge, it is a test of your generic skills. Therefore, the questions in UCAT will
                  be very different to anything you have been exposed to at school and university.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>UCAT is composed of questions drawn from five constructs:</strong>
                </p>
                <p><span>Verbal Reasoning:</span> Assesses the ability to critically evaluate information presented in a
                  written form.</p>
                <p><span>Decision Making:</span> Assesses the ability to make sound decisions and judgements using
                  complex information.</p>
                <p><span>Quantitative Reasoning:</span> Assesses the ability to critically evaluate information
                  presented in a numerical form.</p>
                <p><span>Abstract Reasoning:</span> Assesses the use of convergent and divergent thinking to infer
                  relationships from information.</p>
                <p><span>Situational Judgment:</span> Measures the capacity to understand real-world situations and to
                  identify critical factors and appropriate behaviour in
                  dealing with them.</p>

                <p>Each type of question requires a certain approach, and there are strategies you can learn to help you
                  answer challenging
                  questions quickly and accurately. There are many strategies to learn, which are covered in-depth in
                  both MedEntry’s

                  </span></h4>
                <p>Sitting full-length practice exams under timed conditions is the most effective preparation for UCAT.
                  Doing so will
                  familiarise you with the extreme time pressures that you will face, as well as allowing you to
                  practice concentrating
                  for two hours (something we very rarely do!). Furthermore, full-length exams will expose you to the
                  various types of
                  questions that you will face in UCAT, and reviewing the solutions will help you understand where you
                  went wrong.</p>
                <p>The UCAT Consortium provides practice exams.</p>
                <p>MedEntry provides all students with up to 17 full-length practice exams, as well as thousands of
                  additional practice
                  questions. The UCAT exams are meticulously researched to ensure they simulate both the style and
                  difficulty of the real
                  UCAT. Importantly, because MedEntry has been preparing students for Aptitude tests for over 20 years,
                  we are familiar
                  with the trends and changes that have occurred over the years.</p>

                <p>Once you have completed a few full-length trial exams, you will start to understand your weaknesses.
                  Identify which type
                  of question you find most difficult, and if possible, which subtype of question you find difficult.
                  You should then work
                  on your weaknesses by learning further strategies (by reading the guides and reviewing solutions in
                  depth) and
                  attempting as many practice questions of this type as possible.</p>

                <p>It is also worth noting that for several reasons, the increase in scores with preparation is higher
                  for UCAT than it was
                  for its predecessor, the UMAT, for several reasons.</p>
                <p>Note that quality preparation for UCAT also helps increase your ATAR/GPA because of the thinking
                  skills and test taking
                  skills that you develop.</p>

                  <span>Generally, the more time that you spend on UCAT preparation, the higher your resulting
                    score.</span>
                </p>
                <p>This is why students who are taking a gap year tend to achieve higher scores than they did the
                  previous year, because
                  they have had more time to prepare.</p>
                <p>However, the relationship between preparation time and expected UCAT scores is not linear – it is
                  asymptotic. This
                  means
                  that after a certain amount of preparation time (say about 200 hours), more time on preparation still
                  increases the
                  score but not dramatically.</p>

                <h2 class="title-3">What is a good <span>UCAT score?</span></h2>
                <p>A ‘good UCAT score’ depends on various factors, including which university you are applying to,
                  whether you are
                  considered rural and your academic rank (ATAR/GPA).</p>
                <p>Generally, a percentile rank of over 90 (which is equivalent to a UCAT score of 2920 or over) is a
                  good UCAT score and
                  would be sufficient to obtain an interview.</p>
                <p>This requirement is lower for rural students. It may also vary from year to year depending on the
                  demand for places, as
                  the number of places are fixed.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, at some universities, if your academic rank (GPA/ATAR) is low, you will need a high UCAT
                  score to
                  compensate, and vice versa. Obtaining a high UCAT score will not only increase the probability of you
                  getting in, but
                  you will be able to get in with a higher rank among the students who are accepted: this has numerous
                  benefits.</p>

                <h3 class="title-3">What UCAT score is <span>required for medicine in Australia?</span></h3>
                <p>The score and percentile required to obtain an interview or offer depends on several factors,
                  including: the university
                  you are applying to, the ATAR/GPA you obtain, the state you reside in, the course (lower for courses
                  such as dentistry),
                  where you live (lower for rural students) and what type of place you apply for (lower for Bonded
                  Medical Places, for
                  example). Further offers may be made if you achieve a very high ATAR/GPA.</p>
                <p>In general, a UCAT percentile of about 90 or 2920+ is normally required at most universities. If you
                  are a rural
                  student, you would generally need a percentile of 80 or less.</p>
                <p>Note that many universities do not release cut off UCAT scores required for entry.</p>

                <h3 class="title-3">Is 2500 a good <span>UCAT score?</span></h3>
                <p>Unfortunately, no. A score of 2500 is an average (or mean) score, which equates to about the 50th
                  percentile. Remember
                  that UCAT is very different from school and university. You are being compared to students who are all
                  intelligent and
                  motivated. Therefore, an average score in UCAT does not mean that you are an average student: it means
                  that you have
                  performed averagely among all UCAT candidates..</p>
                <p>In exceptional cases, such as if you are from rural background, you may be able to obtain an
                  interview with a UCAT score
                  of 2500.</p>

                  your UCAT score report
                  is available to view via your Pearson VUE online account. You will need to log into your Pearson VUE

                  your UCAT score report.</p>
                <p>Your Score Report will provide you with a scaled score ranging from 300 to 900 for each subtest, as
                  well as a total
                  score for the cognitive subtests, ranging from 1200 to 3600. Subtest Scores are derived (scaled) from
                  your raw score
                  (the number of questions you got right) using statistical methods that are not made publicly

                  year of high school
                  and thereafter. Furthermore, you can only sit the UCAT once a year. UCAT results are valid for one
