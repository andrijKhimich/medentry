                <p>Two decades ago, when Dr Ray Boyapati and Dr Ann Deely were preparing for their exams, medical entry
                  preparation was
                  unreliable with misleading resources and ineffective teaching techniques.</p>

                <p>Despite excelling in their exams, both obtaining the 100th percentile and scholarships
                  to study medicine, Ray and Ann never forgot how difficult and nerve-racking their preparation had
                  been. They realised
                  hundreds of students were facing the same stressful and potentially career-damaging process, year
                  after year. There had
                  to be a better way
                  of supporting students and ensuring the best talent made it through the arduous process of passing the
                  UCAT exams.</p>

                <p><span><strong>Ray and Ann knew they could create a medical entry program which was better. Much
                      better.</strong></span>
                </p>
                <p>With the help of Edward, a university academic with numerous teaching awards and publications, they
                  set
                  about creating
                  the highest quality and most comprehensive medical entry preparation program available. MedEntry was
                  born.</p>
                <p>MedEntry employs hundreds of staff, tutors and contractors across the world. MedEntry has become
                  synonymous with
                  ‘medical entry’ and is the trusted medical entry organisation, chosen by the best prospective medical
                  students.</p>
                <p>No resources were invested in marketing, yet the word spread among students, and MedEntry quickly
                  grew.
                  Fast forward two
                  decades and MedEntry is now the leading medical entry preparation provider in <span>Australia, New
                    Zealand,
                    Ireland and the
                    United Kingdom.</span></p>
                <p>Ray and Ann are now highly awarded specialist practising consultants (in Gastroenterology and
                  Dermatology respectively)
                  and have each taught over 10,000 aspiring medical students over the past two decades.
                </p>
                <p>MedEntry’s sole aim remains to provide the highest quality preparation program to help students in
                  their journey to
                  becoming a doctor.
